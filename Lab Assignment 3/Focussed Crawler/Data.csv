For maintaining the highest academic standards at PEC the following should be adhered to by all concerned involved in engaging classes and recording the attendance: A. Engagement of Classes:
All classes are to be held as per announced time-table. The time table of an individual faculty member must be displayed outside his/her room and also on the website (standard format available with Webmaster for uploading). No scheduled class should be left unengaged. If a class has to be rescheduled due to certain reasons it must be done with prior intimation to the HOD and the students about the alternate class. Even in emergencies (medical or otherwise) it is the responsibility of a faculty member to inform the HOD or his office by telephone/messenger of the re-scheduling of a class. This information must also reach the students. Normally a class should commence within 5 minutes of the starting time and should finish not earlier than 5 minutes before end time. Only in rare cases say once or twice a semester may a class be disengaged more than 5 minutes before the end-time. Tutorials and practical classes must also be engaged as scheduled. The students must be kept busy during the entire scheduled duration of the class. Classes are to be engaged for the entire semester. There is no provision for completing a course in lesser number of classes than those scheduled as per academic calendar.
B. Attendance:
The Attendance Register must be maintained properly. The attendance should be recorded in terms of progressive number of classes attended by a student. Absence in a particular class should be marked as ‘X’ (see the instructions printed in the register in this regard; other instructions given in the register may be treated as amended according to this document). The attendance status of all students must be announced and displayed outside the office of the course instructor at least thrice every semester – before first mid-term exam before 2nd mid term exam and before the end-term exam. The Attendance Register must be put up to the HOD of the instructor’s department on the first day of every mid-term examination as well as end-term examination for checking/ certification. Thereafter the register is to be kept in safe custody by the Course Instructor.
C. Monitoring:
1. The HODs are to undertake regular monitoring of engagement of classes taking the help of faculty if required. 2. In case a class is found unengaged without intimation with regards to its rescheduling (i) it must be taken on record without exception by the HOD
(ii) the concerned course-instructor must be asked to explain the reasons in writing;
(iii) HODs are to issue suitable response/advice/admonition etc. as deemed appropriate in all cases in writing and report the same to the Director within a week.
3. The Attendance Registers of all the faculty members of the Department must be checked at least twice during every semester – during the days of 1st mid-term & 2nd mid-term exams and once at the end of the semester. The Register is to be returned to the Course Instructor for safe custody.
4. An Institute-level mechanism of monitoring coordinated by a Committee headed by a nominee of the Director will supplement the Departmental process.
Heads of the Departments should bring this to the notice of all concerned in their Departments (by circulation).

Albert Einstein has rightly said “Try not to become a man of success but a man of value.” In line with this theme PEC organized a three day Training Workshop for Faculty Mentors on Induction Programme for New Students that was commenced today in the auditorium of the University. It is being conducted by National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) MHRD under TEQIP-III project from 22nd to 24th September 2017.
The workshop was inaugurated by Dr. Uma Batra Deputy Director PEC. Prof. Anil Kumar Tripathi Professor and Dean IIT Varanasi Dr. Jagmeet Bawa Coordinator and Mr. Jatinder Narula Incharge International Resource Centre for Universal Human Values & Ethics PTU were the keynote speakers who shared their valuable knowledge and experiences with all the participants. Dr. Sanjay Batish Coordinator Deans HoDs and faculty members along with participants were also present during the inaugural ceremony.
Prof. Tripathi elaborated the idea to organize this workshop. It aims to develop sensitivity towards self and one’s relationships builds awareness about others and society beyond the individual. To have harmony in society one must have broad understanding of the society and relationships i.e. several meta-skills and underlying values are needed.
Dr. Jagmeet Bawa shared his remarkable journey in this field by giving his own example and talked about the importance of self- exploration. Mr. Narula highlighted the significant role of education in the holistic development of the society. He quoted “The role of education is to facilitate the development of the competence to live with definite human conduct.” He also discussed about the content and process of education at length.
The workshop recorded a participation of over 90 participants from various NITs Government colleges and universities across the nation. All in all the first day of the workshop was highly enlightening and exploratory.

With the number of college graduates rising every year employers must be strategic in selecting where to recruit. Punjab Engineering College is on the short list of technological institutes targeted by many elite companies because interns and full-time hires from PEC have been success within their organisations. The academic and leadership credentials of our students the calibre of our accomplished faculty the immaculate academic offerings based on IIT’s Academic Model and the variety of extracurricular education available to our students come together to provide a unique and spectacular University.
The Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh was originally established as Mugalpura Engineering College at Lahore (now in Pakistan) on November 9 1921. The name of the Institute was later changed to Maclagan Engineering College and its started functioning under the name on March 19 1924. In the year 1931 the college got affiliated to Punjab University Lahore. After partition in 1947 the Institute was shifted to Roorkee (India) and was renamed as East Punjab College of Engineering. In the year 1950 the word East was dropped and it came to know by the name Punjab Engineering College. Towards the end of December 1953 the Institute shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh to function under Govt. of Punjab. In 1966 with the formation of Union Territory of Chandigarh the institute came under control of Govt. of India through Chandigarh Administration. In October 2003 the Govt. of India notified the Punjab Engineering College as a Deemed to be University and thereafter it became known as Punjab Engineering College (Deemed University).
PEC holds the pride of being one of the first ever technological institutions in India and has a glorious past which is about a century old. In addition PEC has been nationally recognised as one of the finest technological universities in the country.

The event was graced by the Director PEC Prof. Manoj K. Arora and Prof. Sharda Kaushik Head of CMH.
The workshop started with a lamp lighting ceremony. On the first day Mr. Kallakurchi addressed the students and indulged them in light hearted interaction that included many important aspects of life. Mr. Kallakurchi who was himself an unorthodox professor early in his career emphasised that a professional mentor is essential in one's life. He further shared his concern on how the recent technological advancements have taken a toll on youngsters so much so that youngsters today shirk from conventional social interaction.
Addressing the concern of lack of innovation in the field of engineering in India he encouraged the students to take up research and build a career for themselves. "If you're not unique you have no job" said Mr. Kallakurchi. He elaborated that with the zeal to learn one must also put in one's best efforts rather than leaving it to fate. The session for the day ended with an interactive Q & A session leaving the students with curious minds and eagerness for the next day's session.
On the second day the morning session was conducted for the faculty members where Director Dr. Manoj K Arora Head CMH Dr. Sharda Kaushik guest speaker Mr. Jagannath Kallakurchi and the co-ordinator Dr. Anju Singla were present. Dr. Sharda Kaushik welcomed the gathering and felicitated the Director and the guest speaker with bouquets.
During his interaction with the faculty Mr. Jagannath Kallakurchi emphasized the need to integrate ‘goal’ and ‘purpose’ in life. In this interactive session he encouraged the teachers to connect well with their students and to dismiss all age barriers while teaching so as to provide an environment that is congenial for students to learn and develop. He explained how to maintain a healthy teacher-student relationship. He further added that a teacher should be open to comments and feedback and be ready to mould the way of teaching according to the students. He also stressed on the fact that teachers need to recognize their role in nation building because their students are the future of this nation.
In the evening session Mr. Kallakurchi interacted with the students where he primarily focused on entrepreneurship. With the ground rules of differentiation risk taking and faith he explained the basics to become a successful entrepreneur. He discussed their life-goals and guiding them on how to build a better and more successful future for themselves.
The workshop was well received by both the students and the faculty present. The certificates were distributed to the participants followed by felicitating Mr. Kallakurchi with a memento as a token of respect and appreciation. It was ended by a formal vote of thanks delivered by Dr. Anju Singla.
