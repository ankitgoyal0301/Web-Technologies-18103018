A workshop on Smart City Innovation Centre (SCIC) was organized by PEC University of Technology on 22nd February 2017 at the university’s auditorium. Big names like Larsen and Tourbo CISCO NOKIA IBM Intel Sterlite Videocon Dell-EMC SAP ERICSSON Wipro Infosys and many more associated themselves with the project and after a general review of the Centre's objectives individual interactions among the Industrial leaders provided the golden opportunity for brainstorming and inspirational exchange of ideas.
The Smart Cities Mission of the Government is a bold and new initiative. The objective of this mission is to provide core infrastructure and give a good quality of life to its citizens a clean and sustainable environment through application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. Infrastructure services would include Transport Public safety Traffic Water Power Waste disposal Lighting Telecom E Governance. One of the big challenges to this critical mission has been the lack of a platform which helps to present all the potential smart city solutions for all the cities to explore experience and validate the same before including in their respective plans.
In this background PEC one of the most prestigious technology institutions of India in partnership with Chandigarh administration has proposed to build a Smart City Innovation Centre (SCIC) at Chandigarh.
The event commenced with a rousing speech by Dr. Manoj K. Arora Director PEC wherein he talked about the rich history of the institution proving its acumen to be a cohort in innovation of technology in the city.

Honoured officials of the Chandigarh Administration including Mr. Anurag Aggarwal (Home Secretary) graced the event and expressed their admiration and essential support needed for the project. Mr. Aggarwal highlighted that Chandigarh is on a way of becoming not just a smart city but a city with a difference as it qualifies the criterion by just the way it was planned and stands the test of smartness even today. Smart City initiative is said to be different from other schemes prevalent in the country as it forces the cities to compete with one other and in this process think about what they would want them to be perceived as - an innovation centre or a business hub in the years to come. His ambitious speech inspired everyone to align themselves towards the vision of the Prime Minister of the nation so we could all work towards a common goal.
Ms. Surbhi Malik (IAS) Additional Commissioner Ludhiana pointed out that the definition of smart city is variable to the interpretation of its citizens. She talked about the smart city planning in Ludhiana as a good example Area based smart city development in Ludhiana includes the concept of smart roads and smart water supply. Under the project of safe city 15000 cameras have been installed to provide safety to the residents. Garbage management system is an icing on the cake because the generated RDF is used in power generation systems. She spoke about the importance of improvisation and reinvention to plan a smart city that meets its citizens’ needs.
Mr. Purushottam Kaushik (Senior Adviser Mckinsey) expounded upon the practical side of the project and spoke extensively of the benefits of the accomplishment of this mission for various parties involved. He elucidated the following key components of SCIC:
He explained that SCIC is a partnership with industry with the government support and industry acumen to deliver smart solutions to the city making it technologically advanced and independent. Its organizing structure would be managed by the students. SCIC will be the platform where continuous collaboration will be accompanied with opportunities for networking and involvement.
Commissioner Chandigarh Administration Mr. Baldeo Purushartha IAS spoke of the venture as an opportunity for all the students current or former to give back to the alma- mater in terms of capital support and talent. His speech underlined the significance of team work in bringing this project to fruition. A strategic blueprint was offered by Mr. Purushartha which emphasized Chandigarh’s key parameters that give it an edge over other cities and that will make urban planning an exciting but attainable challenge. Some suggestions put forth by him included watershed management and power distribution. Smart power meters energy efficient systems low pollution systems solid waste management and smart infrastructure were some other areas that were focused on. This all-encompassing approach ignited sparks of inspiration in the young minds present and shed light on the importance of brainstorming and a holistic and out-of-the-box methodology.

Quick Links
For maintaining the highest academic standards at PEC the following should be adhered to by all concerned involved in engaging classes and recording the attendance: A. Engagement of Classes:
All classes are to be held as per announced time-table. The time table of an individual faculty member must be displayed outside his/her room and also on the website (standard format available with Webmaster for uploading). No scheduled class should be left unengaged. If a class has to be rescheduled due to certain reasons it must be done with prior intimation to the HOD and the students about the alternate class. Even in emergencies (medical or otherwise) it is the responsibility of a faculty member to inform the HOD or his office by telephone/messenger of the re-scheduling of a class. This information must also reach the students. Normally a class should commence within 5 minutes of the starting time and should finish not earlier than 5 minutes before end time. Only in rare cases say once or twice a semester may a class be disengaged more than 5 minutes before the end-time. Tutorials and practical classes must also be engaged as scheduled. The students must be kept busy during the entire scheduled duration of the class. Classes are to be engaged for the entire semester. There is no provision for completing a course in lesser number of classes than those scheduled as per academic calendar.
B. Attendance:
The Attendance Register must be maintained properly. The attendance should be recorded in terms of progressive number of classes attended by a student. Absence in a particular class should be marked as ‘X’ (see the instructions printed in the register in this regard; other instructions given in the register may be treated as amended according to this document). The attendance status of all students must be announced and displayed outside the office of the course instructor at least thrice every semester – before first mid-term exam before 2nd mid term exam and before the end-term exam. The Attendance Register must be put up to the HOD of the instructor’s department on the first day of every mid-term examination as well as end-term examination for checking/ certification. Thereafter the register is to be kept in safe custody by the Course Instructor.
C. Monitoring:
1. The HODs are to undertake regular monitoring of engagement of classes taking the help of faculty if required. 2. In case a class is found unengaged without intimation with regards to its rescheduling (i) it must be taken on record without exception by the HOD
(ii) the concerned course-instructor must be asked to explain the reasons in writing;
(iii) HODs are to issue suitable response/advice/admonition etc. as deemed appropriate in all cases in writing and report the same to the Director within a week.
3. The Attendance Registers of all the faculty members of the Department must be checked at least twice during every semester – during the days of 1st mid-term & 2nd mid-term exams and once at the end of the semester. The Register is to be returned to the Course Instructor for safe custody.
4. An Institute-level mechanism of monitoring coordinated by a Committee headed by a nominee of the Director will supplement the Departmental process.
Heads of the Departments should bring this to the notice of all concerned in their Departments (by circulation).

Prof. Tripathi elaborated the idea to organize this workshop. It aims to develop sensitivity towards self and one’s relationships builds awareness about others and society beyond the individual. To have harmony in society one must have broad understanding of the society and relationships i.e. several meta-skills and underlying values are needed.
Dr. Jagmeet Bawa shared his remarkable journey in this field by giving his own example and talked about the importance of self- exploration. Mr. Narula highlighted the significant role of education in the holistic development of the society.

With the number of college graduates rising every year employers must be strategic in selecting where to recruit. Punjab Engineering College is on the short list of technological institutes targeted by many elite companies because interns and full-time hires from PEC have been success within their organisations. The academic and leadership credentials of our students the calibre of our accomplished faculty the immaculate academic offerings based on IIT’s Academic Model and the variety of extracurricular education available to our students come together to provide a unique and spectacular University.
The Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh was originally established as Mugalpura Engineering College at Lahore (now in Pakistan) on November 9 1921. The name of the Institute was later changed to Maclagan Engineering College and its started functioning under the name on March 19 1924. In the year 1931 the college got affiliated to Punjab University Lahore. After partition in 1947 the Institute was shifted to Roorkee (India) and was renamed as East Punjab College of Engineering. In the year 1950 the word East was dropped and it came to know by the name Punjab Engineering College. Towards the end of December 1953 the Institute shifted to its present campus in Chandigarh to function under Govt. of Punjab. In 1966 with the formation of Union Territory of Chandigarh the institute came under control of Govt. of India through Chandigarh Administration. In October 2003 the Govt. of India notified the Punjab Engineering College as a Deemed to be University and thereafter it became known as Punjab Engineering College (Deemed University).
PEC holds the pride of being one of the first ever technological institutions in India and has a glorious past which is about a century old. In addition PEC has been nationally recognised as one of the finest technological universities in the country.

One of the major one beings to have a guide or a guru in your life. There needs to be a pallbearer who shows the results and the consequences. It is said Experience speaks much louder than effort does. The second one is to Acquire wisdom faster than it's too late. For growth all the loopholes and advantages have to be known before it's all gone in a snap. Things change faster in the business world than anywhere else. Years of hard work and success can be lost even due to a lack of wisdom. It's important to Respect everything when you have it. Maybe the next second it all goes away and a person is left with nothing else but regret. Growth happens when there is a desire to achieve more at every step. Thus it's natural to Stay hungry stay foolish. Anything and Everything can be done if we Activate our subconscious mind and awaken the giant within. It's all about what we think and how we want to create it. Our mind is the most powerful tool that can be used to achieve the greatest things in life. Let effort be the luckiest thing in your life. Most people believe their success is dependent on the destiny factor. Truth is your hard work is the greatest luck you have. We can write our Future and defy destiny if we decide to achieve. All these learnings play a key role in exponential growth. Just don't try hard and go with what's happening while keeping all these in mind and you shall experience growth and results in no time. Keep thinking keep Creating.

TOPIC OF SESSION 3: MOBLIES AND IOT A NATIONAL SECURITY PERSEPECTIVE
DATE: 6 March 2019 TIME: 10 AM-12 PM
The lecture was given by Suraj Narayanan from DBaux Bangalore on “Moblies and IoT a national security persepective”. He motivated the students that a lot can be done by a software engineer for the national security. For example- Implementing SewageTreatment at Solapur a smart city project for helping the nation. This can be done by placing IoT sensor devices to detect quality and quantity and avoiding the attacks like the case in which the excess chlorine was added in the water. Another project could be Writing software for movement of trucks of military. The major concern regarding this is THE STORAGE OF DATA as the major softwares communicators data storage locations are owned by USA. There is no way of controlling how data gets out of cyber space. We cannot give smart phones to “jawans” as there will be a risk of privacy breach. The practical example of this is Kargil war in which GPS was turned off by USA and we lost around 5000 soldiers. Similar case can be observed in JalliKattu Riots. All of these incidents conclude that we are secure physically but not from cyber space point of view. They can manipulate the data as they required commonly known as Information Warfare.The term means that mindset of the people can be changed based on the collected data. The real life example of this is Cambridge Analytica personalised adds to manipulate the perception of people. Few terms were introduced like CyberCommons CyberColony CyberColonial Power. Some of the achievements done by his company for nation include Seculink-Domain controller with patch management is provided to the defence of India to control whole network so that data remains within you Seculink UTMS AvrakOS- in this open source code of some OS is picked and that part is cleaned where the data goes out SecuMobile-specially designed for Indian defence with 100% owning of the software.

Around 550 students from various branches of the college attended this highly informative session each day as per the slots for students from different years.
Lt. Col Rakesh Krishnan began the session with his speech on “Mindset- the Edge” where he talked about how our mindset can either make us or break us. He explained that a “fixed mindset” assumes that our character intelligence and creative ability are static and cannot change in any meaningful way. A “growth mindset” on the other hand thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
He encouraged the students to adopt the latter and gave practical tips to change one’s mindset to maximize their chances of success.
Capt. Yashika Hatwal Tyagi was the next speaker. A Silver Medallist from Officer’s Training Academy who participated in Operation Rhino & Operation Vijay and also a Mentor & Career Counsellor she elucidated the power of optimism through her inspiring life story.

As a college student she represented India as student ambassador to Canada under a cross cultural exchange program called Indo-Canada Youth Exchange Program.
After completing her graduation when the Indian army was accepting female applicants for the first time she was among the only 25 selected candidates out of thousands of applications.
She gave a very important message when she said “It’s better to choose the hard right than to go for the easy wrong”. After hanging her boots she successfully raised & executed the model of ECHS a ministry of defence project wherein she worked towards providing effective healthcare delivery to the veterans of Defence Services staying in remote corners of counter-insurgency infested areas of Jorhat Assam and Srinagar J&K.
As she finished her speech the entire hall was up on its feet and for the next 30 seconds the entire hall was reverberating with the claps.
The session continued with Mr. Arpan Dixit Business Head- Fitness and Marketing CATFIT. The major topic of his discussion was Pre During and Post interview psychology in which he spoke about the preparation communication and presentation skills. The session was very interactive. Around 300-350 students attended the session. He covered the entire spectrum from making an impactful and well balanced CV in the pre-interview stage to the etiquette for carrying oneself during the interview with confidence. He emphasised the importance of soft skills – tone of voice non-verbal cues the choice of words and vocabulary to be used – and how it can impact the interview. He conducted a short mock interview of two volunteers from the audience to demonstrate the art of interviewing in practice.

The event started with an exuberant dance performance by dramatics club on Bollywood dance numbers such as "desi boys" and "maa da ladla”. The energy of the performance overwhelmingly captured the heart of the audience. Following up there were dance performances on peppy songs like "dilli wali girlfriend" “dil chori" and "ishaqzaade" etc. The retro feel of Bollywood was revived by hilarious fillers like "piya piya" and "choli ke piche".
The students performed a satirical skit titled “Ache Din Kab aayenge” in which the students perfectly portrayed politicians in their daily lives and the struggle. The use of red spotlight in the skit “Aao Hoot Bhagayen” made the scene pictursque and audience were taken back by the entry of the Ghost. The skit was a standout in terms of sound and lighting.
Then the story of why Mechanical Engineering branch has a very poor sex ratio was outstandingly shown in the skit “Na Dhin Dhin Na”. The last skit “Sabka Katega” which had brilliant characters and well-timed punches was very much celebrated amongst the audience.
The beautiful smiles and expressions of the ladies stole the show whereas attitude and style of the boys was phenomenal. The event showcased various dance forms like contemporary hip hop classical taandav salsa etc. Giving a glimpse of the western world there were some English songs such as 24k magic uptown funk love me like you do.
The senior members poured out their inner comedians in between the skits only to make the entertainment quotient even better.

Background
Privacy and Protection is a subject that has seen massive developments in the last few years. Undoubtedly with the advent of big data and blurring jurisdictions and processes there have been many questions about data and its rationale in national security rights of citizens etc.
Cyber Security Research Centre (CSRC) at Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University); Chandigarh had organised the first workshop to carry out a study of the Justice Srikrishna Committee Paper(first draft) on Data Protection from a National Security Perspective on Jan 28 2018. The finings of the study were shared in the form of report carrying recommendations to Meity which were duly considered.
Along the same lines there have been multiple citizen movements centric to the idea of data privacy and rights of data principals/users. Debates about surveillance data localisation defining key terms and the concurrence with the GDPR have been ongoing and have slowly occupied centre stage.
As a result of these discussions with various experts and recent developments in the domain it was felt that a comprehensive list of comments and recommendations must be prepared after brainstorming exercises with multiple stakeholders. Data in the long run is most likely going to drive nations policies and international relations as well. To further this objective of understanding the draft bill and working on the issues that it has presented it has become an urgent need to present the right problems and alternate solutions to the lawmakers.
The deadline for the submission has been extended to September 30 2018
CSRC PEC and Cyber Peace Foundation have come together to organise another two days long workshop and discussions on Sept 24 – 25 2018 on the draft law.
Major Highlights and Discussions of the Day:
Gen. D.S. Hooda
He bought out the point that there can be no privacy without security. There needs to be different laws/provisions to cover CII (Critical Info Infrastructure) where the Government and various sensitive organizations and their manpower are covered with special provisions. Indigenous Technology will be a key component in this particular data protection framework. The proposed Data Protection Authority of India should mandatorily have members who are from military background with specialization in Information Warfare.
DR. DIVYA BANSAL PROFESSOR AND HEAD CSRC
The Consent based framework has two be two fold. A draft personal data protection bill today proposed "explicit consent" for processing 'sensitive personal information. 'Sensitive personal data' comprises of data including passwords financial data genetic data health data sexual orientation caste or tribe or religious or political belief.
Should politicians also be made to notify or seek choices and declare as to how they plan to track our likes and dislikes and profile individuals for political purposes and influence minds by targeting individuals using personalised advertisements? One may also want to look into whether tailored political advertising would affect National Sovereignty.
Given that our Nation is going leaps and bounds progressively towards the Technology Advancements like AI Big Data IoT and Cloud. Globally we are moving on to become a Data Driven Decision Making. Individuals are profiled based upon the data so collected and automated decision making takes place on the basis of data so collected and integrated and correlated. In the UK automated decision making based upon data being sponsored collected from different sources including social media has evolved into credit scores and are being used to determine whether people can get a credit card or loan. It may become a nightmare if the “social credit” system as developed by Chinese government determining the “trustworthiness” of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens. This Social credit might prevent people from buying airline and train tickets and many other activities (launched in 2014 and is supposed to be nationwide by 2020)
While we are looking at explicit consent based framework in Draft Data Protection Fill shouldn’t Individuals also have the right of not to be a part of results of automated decision making and hence have right to opt out?
DR. SD PRADHAN FORMER Dy. NSA & JIC CHAIRMAN MEMBER ADVISORY BOARD CSRC
In the Round Table Workshop various aspects related to the draft Personal Data were discussed. The participants stressed that all the data aggregated and processed through advanced algorithm becomes national strategic asset and therefore it must be ensured that data is not misused for subversion of national sovereignty. The naming of Data Processing Authority was also discussed and there was a census that there should be a specialized cadre for this task. The members also pointed out that data when not needed should be deleted. They also emphasized that all personal data must be stored in servers in India. Mr. Vineet President Cyber peace Foundation Team
MR. RAJ PAGARIYA MR. ABHAY SINGH & MR. NITISH CHANDAN Cyber Peace Foundation Team
MS. GEETA GULATI Lawyer Punjab & Haryana High Court
Other Important Questions which were raised
The discussions and brainstorming done during the workshop was found to be very insightful. The illustrious experts represented national security experts like Gen. D.S. Hoada Dr. S.D. Pradhan renowned lawyers expert in the subject academicians and researchers and representation from the industry. The workshop will conclude tomorrow in which some very important issues on Data Localization and cross border flow of data will also be discussed and the discussions and recommendations will be compiled to be sent to the Government of India. The exercise has been found to be very useful as domain experts from various fields participated in making of the very important Data Protection law of India which a historical move in itself.

DAY 1: 04/9/2018
Session 1: Scenario based problems for Security Plan Security Analysis and Security Design
Speaker: Cmdr. L.R. Parkash
Commander L.R. Parkash director CDAC – Chennai began the session with a brief introduction of various activities being conducted at CDAC-Chennai which includes developing open source software; security related products and conducting various training programmes. The lecture started with the definition of the word ‘security’ and he quoted that security is fully dependent on context. He further emphasized on Enterprise View which can be referred as combination of Business Continuity Management Information Security and IT Disaster Recovery. Security Plan can be mentioned as a formal plan of action to secure a computer or information system. He gave the example of a College Network System to briefly explain about the implementation of security planning. The speaker also focussed on Risk Assessment and Analysis which included Threat Asset and Vulnerability and supplemented it with the example of JAVA Exploit. Different phases of Security System Development Life Cycle were discussed. The session summed up listing various international security standards like MOF COBIT SABSA NIST ISO/IEC-27000 for generating security plans and highlighting the importance of Security Education Training and Awareness Programme.
Session 2: Security Review through Security Audit
Speaker: Cmdr. L.R. Parkash
Cmdr. L.R. Parkash started the session by highlighting how to write an information security plan for a particular system. Security plan document mainly specifies purpose and scope mission and vision organizational structure output and information assets etc. An information asset need not be limited to IT systems. Information assets summary plays crucial role to find out scope of system. Workflows and other processes that are important to the administration of the organization need to be secured. While writing information security plan one must be specific but being too specific may lead to backdoors or vulnerabilities into the system. So a balance must be attained. He interacted with the audience and discussed what personal data is and why critical sensitive data should be kept private. All students were grouped to make a sample information security plan document for PEC. Risk assessment listing all acceptable risks privacy controls and security initiatives are other factors which need to be considered while planning information security plan. Session ended up with list of 20 CSC (Critical Security Controls) which are decisive to any information security plan. CSC is kept in appendix part of plan document.
DAY 2: 05/9/2018
Session 1: Cryptography
Speaker: Cmdr. L. R. Parkash
Commander L. R. Parkash began the session on cryptography protocols by interacting with the students and sharing various real-life examples of encryption and decryption. He talked about Symmetric vs. Asymmetric key encryption and their various issues. There is an exponential increase in the number of keys to be shared in case symmetric key encryption. It also becomes matter of concern how to share the key securely. On the other hand Asymmetric key encryption needs to address physical key distribution and key revocation issues. Although Asymmetric key encryption provides confidentiality authentication integrity and non-repudiation however in practice it is not scalable and it is must costlier. So in practice hybrid encryption approach utilising symmetric as well as asymmetric encryption is used. He interacted with students to generate a keypair and send an encrypted message to each other. Speaker also discusses about the Public Key Infrastructure and how the certificates are signed and shared. A certificate authority issues a certificate provides the public key and checks the key revocation. At the end the students were grouped and asked to set up a Certificate Authority Server generate certificates and GPG system. This added a dimension of practical implementation to his session and intrigued everyone in attendance.
Session 2: Blockchain Technology
Speaker: Mr. Arshdeep Bagha
Mr. Arshdeep Bagha Director Cloudemy Technology Labs LLP Chandigarh started the session discussing the four industrial revolutions the fourth one being the Cyber Physical Systems. He explained the concept of blockchain technology along with its evolution. Further he discussed about web 1.0 web 2.0 and web 3.0 in which blockchain came under the ambit of web 3.0. The speaker further explained the basic concepts related to blockchains like its definition structure Merkel tree etc. He explained the difference between blockchain and Bitcoin and talked about Santoshi Nakamoto and his paper “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer electronic cash system”. Some of the characteristics of blockchain were discussed e.g. immutable secure and transparent no central authority privacy scalable and many more. He explained various types of smart contracts like crowd funding contracts escrow smart contracts voting smart contract etc. Further he elaborated upon the Blockchain stack and some of the differences between web app and decentralised app. He also outlined some of the applications of blockchain like Banks insurance solar charging stations shipment tracking and many more. A demonstration of a solar charge app was given. He discussed the double spending problem which refers to the spending of same money more than once and wrapped up the session with some of the challenges and future prospects in blockchain technology.
Session 3: Cryptography Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Signatures
Speaker: Cmdr. L.R. Parkash
Cmdr. L.R Parkash began by talking about Cryptography Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Signatures. The speaker explained how different types of websites are certified by Certifying Authorities (CAs). Financial websites require a lot more checks as compared to other websites therefore extended validations are applied by them to get certificates from CA. He also spoke about secure communication using symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques and explicated the concept of domain by defining it as a boundary of control. A brief explanation of the root CA was given and where this root CA is present. Taking an example of DigiCert he mentioned that the root CA also has many intermediate CAs which share its workload. There are different types of certificates such as personal certificates commercial certificates other people certificates etc. The contents of a certificate were discussed in detail. CDAC has developed a digital signing system known as e-Hastakshar- CDAC’s eSign service that facilitates instant signing of documents online by citizens in a legally acceptable form. He ended the talk with the discussion of eSign architecture and motivated the students to work in the area of digital signatures and other relevant spheres of technological advancement needed in our modern society.
Session 4: Hands-on Workshop on Competitive Programming
Speaker: Mr. Sandeep Jain Mr. Ayushman Bansal
The founders of the extremely popular learning database- Geeks for Geeks- started the session with the story of their website’s inception and how their aim was to motivate students to prepare for placement interviews. They mentioned their humble beginnings and how they used to contact students from IITs to know about interview questions and patterns and then they prepared for the same questions in order to crack placement interview. While learning through this process the team came up with idea of building their own group to share interview experience and questions hence came up with a big platform for the same. Data Structures and Design of Algorithms are two key subjects to be mastered for a computer science student according to the speakers. These core subjects play a vital role in every job profile and must be mastered. They spoke about fair pay and disclosed that they give remuneration to students for their contribution to geeks for geeks. Various key categories of geeks for geeks website were also discussed to help students to start their preparation. Internship programs are also offered by geeks for geeks to students to excel their skillset. The talk ended up with an interactive questions and answer session with the enthusiastic students.
DAY 3: 06/9/2018
Session 1: Key-length Management
Speaker: Cmdr. L. R. Parkash
Commander L. R. Parkash began the session by discussing symmetric and asymmetric key length management. Brute force attack on the key involves large computation and a parallel processing is often involved for effective brute force. He gave an example of Chinese Lottery to understand the concept of parallel processing involved for brute-force. Key length management has practical and mandatory safeguards which need to be followed. The concept behind the Dictionary attack Length Extension attack and Rainbow Table attack was discussed in detail. A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a password (or credit card numbers etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. However a Rainbow Table does not work for Linux passwords. Salting is a means of preventing a Rainbow Table attack. A commonly used cryptosystem for GSM communications is the A5 ciphering algorithm. He advised to have an up to date knowledge on the legal advisor regarding the length of the keys. A case study on recently held cyber-attack called ‘ATM Jackpotting Attack’ on Pune based Cosmos Bank was discussed. The ATM jackpotting technique is basically an exploitation of both physical and software vulnerabilities in banking kiosks or dispensing machines such as ATMs. At the end of the session speaker motivated the students to read these real-life case studies analyse various security lapses and relate them with theoretical knowledge.
Session 2: Virtual Private Networks
Speaker: Cmdr. L. R. Parkash
Commander L. R. Parkash introduced the concept of port addresses and NAT. NAT maps private IP address to public IP address. The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use for both economy and security purposes. Port addresses are used to send packets to particular application on a system. Some services or processes have conventionally assigned permanent port numbers. These are known as well-known port numbers. In other cases a port number is assigned temporarily (for the duration of the request and its completion) from a range of assigned port numbers. Various security features and attacks in this model are elaborated with suitable examples. For example there may be DoS or DDoS attack on the web server by sending multiple bogus requests to web server to occupy all ports on server. Natting makes provisions such that no outside packet can reach to private network. Net neutrality concept and implications were discussed with students. ISP may peep into personalized traffic to route traffic differently to different users. Further the speaker talked about Virtual Private Networks. VPN technology was developed as a way to allow remote users and branch offices to securely access corporate applications and other resources. To ensure safety data travels through secure tunnels and VPN users must use authentication methods -- including passwords tokens and other unique identification methods -- to gain access to the VPN. Session ended with Cmdr. Parkash motivating the students to thoroughly study basic and advanced communication infrastructure over the internet and create solutions to our day-to-day problems.
DAY 4: 07/9/2018
Session 1: Applied Cryptographic Applications
Speaker: Cmdr. L. R. Parkash
Cmdr. L. R. Parkash started the session discussing about Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunneling. VPN Tunneling has three components Carrier Passenger and Encapsulation of data. A thorough explanation of how the data is transmitted and encapsulated over VPN was given. Tunneling can be done site-to-site or through remote access in VPNs. The various advantages of VPN include greater scalability mobility security cost effectiveness etc. The major disadvantages of VPN are unpredictable internet traffic and understanding of different security issues. A brief presentation was given on the topic of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used to obtain MAC address from a given IP address. ARP is a stateless protocol which does two jobs that are responding to a query and ownership announcement. ARP cache tables are maintained to map MAC addresses from IP addresses. The major drawback of ARP is ARP spoofing. ARP announcements are not authenticated the requests are not tracked and ARP tables can be easily poisoned by man-in-the-middle attack. Various solutions to ARP spoofing involve software-detection solutions such as Xarp ArpWatch Anti-arpspoof and MAC binding. The speaker ended the lecture with a amall talk on TCP Session Hijacking Droppers and BotNets.
Session 2: Digital Business Transformations
Speaker: Mr. Prashant Mehta Sapient
Mr Prashant Mehta VP of Sapient started session mentioning growth of marketing technology landscape over 7 years. We are moving from a mobile first to an AI- first world. It is hard to overstate how big if an impact AI is going to have on society in next 20 years. He mentioned quote by Andrew NG AI is the new electricity. Robots will have an IQ of 10000 in 30 years. The average life span of an S & P company was about 65 years in the 1960s. Now it’s closer to15 years and it’s projected to get even shorter in the coming years. Four out of ten companies are top ranked companies in their industry won’t survive in the next five years. The pace of change we see today will be a pale shadow of the unfolding future. Future happens very slowly and then all at once. We are at the beginning of the most transformative revolution ever. Whilst many of the technique and algorithm of machine learning and AI have been around since 1950s only recently we have three factors coincided to provide access to scalable and replicable solutions: cost of compute and storage has fallen; a huge abundance of data and smarter algorithms. He also threw light on five pillars of transformations namely Data and AI cloud sensor ways of working and culture. Talk ended up motivating students to learn and improve their self with time.
Session 3: Information Security Threats
Time: 02.00 PM – 04.00 PM
Date: 07/09/2018
Cdr L.R Prakash .Head CDAC Chennai in the session discussed about security auditing  social engineering and proxy servers. He defined security auditing as a systematic evaluation of the security of a company's information system by measuring how well it conforms to a set of established criteria. Further he explained the concept of proxy with the help of a simple example. A proxy server he stated is a dedicated computer or a software system running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between endpoint device . He further stated that proxy helps to speed up the operations. Proxy he explained is used mainly for control security and convenience .Speaker also briefly stated about squid proxy .Moving the discussion further he explained the concept of social engineering with some real life examples. Social engineering he referred to as psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. He gave example of Royal Bank of Scotland to further explain the concept. Giving the example of Jharkhand gang he explained how using Social engineering this gang used aadhar verification calls to target pension accounts .Awareness among the users he suggested as the only way forward to tackle this problem of Social engineering .He further outlined some of famous attacks like petya and wannacry attack .

Under DST sponsored project of “Big Data Analytics – HSRS Data (BDA-HSRS)” Dr L. N Sharma Associate Professor Department of Applied Sciences PEC University of Technology has been awarded a project as Co-PI with research grant of Rs 21 Lakh to study snow and glaciers. It is a cluster of multi-institutional national networked project. Dr Sharma happens to be among top researchers who have been selected from prestigious organisations of national repute like IIT- Bombay Kanpur Chennai Kharagpur IIST-ISRO DTRL DRDO IARI and Central Universities etc it said. It will involve 4 Region-wise central laboratory facilities which will also maintain data acquired. The IIT- Bombay has been identified as national nodal agency to coordinate and maintain data portal of the project through setting up a coordination cell. Total duration of the project is 3 years. The project involves characterization of physical and optical properties of different forms of snow and glaciers using ground truth data collection and remote sensing techniques he pointed out. The physical process analysis of snow features will provide crucial information to understand and model the snow physical parameters. This will help in creating a data base of such processes from field input and up scaling them on satellite data and thus will help in better understanding of snow and glacier formation. The major beneficiaries of the output of the project will be Army BRO DRDO Deptt of Space Labs MoEF MoES Hydroelectric Energy Producers Agriculture operators etc. Having second project on glaciers to his credit Dr Sharma is involved in paleoclimatic studies of glaciers (Hamtah and Siachin) for more than a decade is opined that west Himalayan glaciers are definitely retreating due to global warming. Right from its origin i.e 4600 million years earth had five ice ages. The variations in the Earth’s orbit and shifting plate tectonics spur the waxing and waning of these periods. At present we are living in the interglacial warmer period hence geologically speaking there is nothing abnormal about global warming. However anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases and intensive use of fossil fuels have alarmed the situation to such an extent that human beings own existence is at stake.

There are three sets of sensors: one of which sense any type of Power failure  second will sense the entry or exit of any unwanted person in the absence of owner of house third for sensing any type of fire . When any type of Power failure is sensed by the Power failure sensor it will get activated an give a low signal to microcontroller’s pin  and this pin when sensed by the microcontroller then it will activate the audio visual alarm apart from this a SMS is also sent to the owner of house. Similarly when any person enters in the house through the door then an intruder circuit (which act as a sensor for sensing the entry or exit of an unwanted person) will get activated and give a low signal to microcontroller which is sensed by the controller. Then controller in turn activates the audio visual alarm and also sends a SMS to the owner of house. Similarly when any type of fire is sensed by the fire sensor it will get activated an a low signal is send to the microcontroller which in turn activates the audio visual alarm and also sends an SMS to the owner of house

Materials are the backbone of our civilization and strengthening the backbone is an ardent duty of every engineer. Metallurgical and Materials engineers however support the most promising role in this business process.
The functions of a Metallurgical and Materials Engineering professional are to make primary metal/ materials shape them into desired form and features and treat them to assure superlative performances etc. Better functions are always achieved at the stance of better designs and material design is a competency which we at the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering aspire to render in our students.
The product of our department has done well towards placing the material industry in higher echelons of global world is the proverbial proof of a good pudding our students create in the pie they develop as an aspect of our training. The synergy of our Metallurgical Engineering educations goes well with the competencies in consulting; and the industrial liaison faculty of this department maintains with the industry.
Last but not the least the size is no indication of the role the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering professionals demonstrate. In view of the latter there is a big responsibility and journey ahead.

Construction and demolition waste generation has exceedingly increased around the world. Out of various types of construction and demolition waste concrete constitutes about 80% of the total waste. Therefore it is necessary to recycle concrete waste to recycled aggregate and recycled aggregate concrete. As concrete is an essential mass-produced material in the construction industry efforts have been made to recycle and to conserve it. Concrete recycling have recently become important aspects of the construction industry as is the case for steel and aluminum. Moreover due to continuous exploitation of aggregates from natural resources there is now depletion of quality aggregates. In fact many governing bodies throughout the world have now introduced various measures aimed at reducing the use of primary aggregates and increasing reuse and recycling of aggregates. UK government has introduced a number of policies to encourage wider use of secondary and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as an alternative to naturally occurring primary aggregates.
The main activity of the group is to focus on investigating properties of high performance concrete using recycled concrete aggregates. It will cover the following aspects: a) Mechanical properties of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates b) Durability aspects of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates c) Behavior of RCC elements of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates

The ground water sources are getting polluted due to percolating city waste waters industrial effluents and other waste waters such as agricultural runoff meeting the polluted water drains. Though some times the percolating rainwater may also carry minerals of earth crust soils to the ground water and pollute it. For examples Arsenic pollution in West Bengal and fluoride pollution of ground water in states like Haryana M.P. Rajastahan and Andhra Pradesh. However as polluted surface waters have larger impact on ground water in their surrounding region they are major source of ground water pollution. Such polluted ground water has affected human health in many parts of the country. The impact of such polluted water on ground water therefore needs to be studied analyzed and monitored so as to ensure potability and suitability of such ground water.
The main activity of the group is to take up the extensive research project is formulated in which the extent of existing ground water contamination its suitability for various uses and the impact of polluted percolating waste water on it shall be studied. Further the contribution of harmful minerals of soil strata to ground water pollution due to leaching of these minerals with percolating rain water shall also be studied.

Energy and environment are the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Nanomaterials with their attractive chemical and physical properties are being explored for their potential in energy environmental electronic and magnetic applications. In nanostructured materials the elemental steps of energy conversion like charge transfer molecular rearrangement chemical reactions etc. take place on the nanoscale. Technical energy applications exploiting nanomaterials include harvesting of light batteries thermoelectric generation H storage materials etc. Novel nanoelectronic and nanomagnetic materials are interesting from the point of view of the relationship between microstructural features and the electronic and magnetic properties. Such features include particle size and distribution chemical inhomogeneities crystalline defects and crystallographic texture. Technical applications exploiting magnetic nanomaterials include magnetic data storage sensors materials for biotechnology generation and distribution of electric power and other biomedical aspects. Many of our modern technological devices rely on magnetism and magnetic materials like electrical power generators and transformers electric motors computers and components of sound and video reproduction systems.This has led to various opportunities such as improving the quality of magnetic resonance imaging hyperthermic treatment for malignant cells site-specific drug delivery and the manipulation of cell membranes. The activities of the group will include synthesis and structural characterization of nanomaterials for electronic magnetic and energy applications.

Construction and demolition waste generation has exceedingly increased around the world. Out of various types of construction and demolition waste concrete constitutes about 80% of the total waste. Therefore it is necessary to recycle concrete waste to recycled aggregate and recycled aggregate concrete. As concrete is an essential mass-produced material in the construction industry efforts have been made to recycle and to conserve it. Concrete recycling have recently become important aspects of the construction industry as is the case for steel and aluminum. Moreover due to continuous exploitation of aggregates from natural resources there is now depletion of quality aggregates. In fact many governing bodies throughout the world have now introduced various measures aimed at reducing the use of primary aggregates and increasing reuse and recycling of aggregates. UK government has introduced a number of policies to encourage wider use of secondary and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) as an alternative to naturally occurring primary aggregates.
The main activity of the group is to focus on investigating properties of high performance concrete using recycled concrete aggregates. It will cover the following aspects: a) Mechanical properties of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates b) Durability aspects of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates c) Behavior of RCC elements of HPC using recycled concrete aggregates

The ground water sources are getting polluted due to percolating city waste waters industrial effluents and other waste waters such as agricultural runoff meeting the polluted water drains. Though some times the percolating rainwater may also carry minerals of earth crust soils to the ground water and pollute it. For examples Arsenic pollution in West Bengal and fluoride pollution of ground water in states like Haryana M.P. Rajastahan and Andhra Pradesh. However as polluted surface waters have larger impact on ground water in their surrounding region they are major source of ground water pollution. Such polluted ground water has affected human health in many parts of the country. The impact of such polluted water on ground water therefore needs to be studied analyzed and monitored so as to ensure potability and suitability of such ground water.
The main activity of the group is to take up the extensive research project is formulated in which the extent of existing ground water contamination its suitability for various uses and the impact of polluted percolating waste water on it shall be studied. Further the contribution of harmful minerals of soil strata to ground water pollution due to leaching of these minerals with percolating rain water shall also be studied.

Computational Modeling of Helicopter Rotor Blades made up of Smart Composite Materials - Chirag Sachdeva
The project aims at the development of next generation of intelligent helicopter rotor blades. With the use of smart composite materials these intelligent structures would be able to sense the external environment flight conditions and monitor the structural health in real time.
The current state of tools for analyzing smart structures is primitive while simultaneously being expensive and prohibitively time-consuming. To achieve the real-time state awareness capabilities a tool based on mathematically rigorous Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) is developed. VAM splits a three-dimensional elasticity problem into a two-dimensional linear cross-sectional problem and a one-dimensional beam problem. It ensures the asymptotic correctness since the method makes no ad hoc assumptions. This is accomplished by taking advantage of certain small parameters inherent to beam-like structures. Thus the high-tech rotor blade designs that would be computationally intensive to investigate using 3D Finite Element Analysis can therefore be quickly and effectively analyzed using the newly developed tool.
The smart piezoelectric materials can act as both Sensors as well as Actuators. During flight operations these rotor blades shall develop potential differences across the material layers which could be harvested to analyze the health of the blades and flight conditions of operation. This could reduce the number of inspections on the blade and the human error that might appear in the inspections done visually. Additionally to mitigate the flutter and stall conditions the embedded control units could provide with the actuation voltage to bring about the structural morphing based upon real time computational inputs.
Personal Emotional Doctor (Bot) - Gaurav Arora
Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that affects person's thoughts. A good counselling when you're low can do wonders; a motivational speech can get you started towards your fightback a good relationship advice can help in relationship crisis. We do have people around us who motivate us in tough times with their experiences of life butthey end up being judgemental and emotionally biased because of which we’re not able to completely share our feelings with humans and are left fighting sadness alone.
A machine can't be emotionally biased and judgemental. We plan on building a bot that gives personalized counselling to the "sad" person. The bot will maintain a repository of motivational psychological content available on the internet through religious scriptures through psychological books and will interact with the sad person using that knowledge to heal him. The "sad" person can trust the machine because it won't tell his problem to anyone else nor would it get judgemental as normal human beings do. On a machine we would have the power to keep only positive information in memory so that it only gives Unconditional personalized positivity.
We plan to build the bot using Natural Language Processing to understand the "sad" person's problem using Semantic-Nets(in Artificial Intelligence) at the backend to reply. The replies will be formed from the knowledge-base that is maintained by the system. The proposed knowledge-base system will be formed by extracting information from motivational lectures books which give people Relationship advices. We plan to extract information from spiritual content available to help people emotionally.
Social Data Mining To Counter Terrorism - Ketan Sud
Terrorism is a global issue which is affecting many nations directly or indirectly. Analyzing Terrorist Networks is the emerging field of analytics which have been explored in many subdomains viz. authorship analysis multilingual text mining feature extraction of dedicated terrorist groups generating situational alerts or emergency responding systems etc. Terrorist Network Analysis is one of the applications which can help security intelligence to better understand the structure of social networks of terrorist groups of interest. Social media is a largely untapped source when it comes to effective methods of terrorism and while research on the topic exists the reliance of major intelligence agencies is on traditional methods of identifying and countering terroristic intents. This project aims to use data sourced from Twitter and gradually other social networking sites and portals to create a predictive model to aid in the identification of perpetrators of terroristic activity that may take place.
Designing the Multiband Microstrip Patch Antenna (MSPA) for Rectenna - Sunny Kumar
The project aims to make Microstrip Patch Antennas for the purpose of designing Rectenna. This antennas is a combinational placement of three layers followed by Ground plane Substrate and Patch (copper) on the top. In simple words A Rectenna is a device which is combination of Antenna and Rectifier Circuit. Rectenna converts Microwave range frequencies into the DC current. Therefore I am designing this device for the purpose of Wireless power Harvesting. Wireless power harvesting is a new technology to harvest power from the ambient radio waves.
The ability to harvest RF energy from ambient or dedicated sources enables wireless charging of low-power devices and has resulting benefits to product design usability and reliability. So we can convert this energy into the electrical power by using the devices like Rectenna. Therefore we can use this energy to provide power our small power required devices. It is true that the energy obtained by this technology is not very high but we can make our sensors and other small equipment automatic working. By using this technology battery-based systems can be trickled charged to eliminate battery replacement or extend the operating life of systems using disposable batteries. Battery-free devices can be designed to operate upon demand or when sufficient charge is accumulated. In both cases these devices can be free of connectors cables and battery access panels and have freedom of placement and mobility during charging and usage. The Harvested energy can be used to charge or operate a wide range of low-power devices. At close range to a low-power transmitter this energy can be used to trickle charge a number of devices including GPS or RLTS tracking tags wearable medical sensors and consumer electronics such as e-book readers and headsets. Depending on the power requirements and system operation power can be sent continuously on a scheduled basis or on-demand. In large-scale sensors deployments significant labor cost avoidance is possible by eliminating the future maintenance efforts to replace batteries.
Biometric Based Locking System - Gaurav Shukla
A number of biometrics have been in use to identify individuals the standard one being based on fingerprints other relying over DNA hand geometry face iris retina signature ear-shape voice etc. However each of these has some minor setbacks. These are long testing times like in case of DNA (It takes 24-72 hours for identification). Or susceptible to duplication (face hand prints signature etc.).
However another biometric based on EEG has come up in the recent years. It is one of the most fraud resistant biometrics. A research study has found a direct relationship between the EEG and the genetic information of a person. Therefore EEG is a unique parameter over which user identification can be performed. EEG signals are used to record the electrical activity from the brain. These are recorded non-invasively from the scalp using electrodes placed on standard positions throughout it.
My objectives are to firstly identify the features in the EEG of a person that are unique as well as robust therefore not varying with time. Then I have to develop my own EEG headset after I have identified the lobes from where the unique features have been extracted. All the above objectives once met can be linked to almost any locking system that can be used in safes doors vehicles etc. Completion of this project can solve a number of problems pertaining to security and has a greater scope in the coming years when the reliance on other standard biometrics will decrease and new security tools will be required. Even Elon Musk has shown interest in Brain Computer Interfacing technology by creating Neuralink a company set upto develop advanced biotechnology enhancements for the human brain. The project I am working on can solve a number of problems pertaining to security and has a greater scope in the coming years when the reliance on other standard biometrics will decrease and new security tools will be required.
Lead-free Pyroelectric Material for Energy Harvesting Applications - Nikhil Arora (now Subham Panda)
In our project the thrust is for looking advanced materials with ultra-high pyroelectric performance around room temperature and thus the present work is an attempt to explore the Barium Calcium Titatanate (BCT) with various dopants. These materials have permanent dipoles which change their orientation on the application of the heating and cooling of these materials.
A number of thermal energy harvesting devices are based on thermoelectric photovoltaic and solar thermal where pyroelectric materials have unique advantage as these respond only on thermal fluctuations. One of the energy harvesting applications using these materials could be during dawn and dusk time as photovoltaic devices cannot efficiently work during this period. It is due to fact that solar energy is not sufficient enough for photovoltaic devices during dusk and dawn. Whereas pyroelectric devices can perform more effectively because of large temporal temperature changes during these time frame. Pyroelectric energy harvesting devices are complementary with other devices in true sense.
In this work where various materials circuit and different methods are being explored. All the findings may suggest an avenue to design pyroelectric devices having superior performance and possible substitution to lead based ceramics. On successful completion of the project we can make the energy system of the world completely environment-friendly and lead-free. Utilising the wasted heat to harvest energy can put a huge impact on the energy scarcity of the world.
Solar Powered Load Carrying Bot - Tarun Goyel
This project aims at developing an eco-friendly solar powered load carrying. This bot is completely different form the other bots already present in the market. Its power consumption is ¼ times the power that other bots carry and is a whole new concept of charging it with solar power. A completely revolutionized innovation that can charge the batteries in just 4 hours via solar panel and once completely charged it can work continuously work for 8 hours. It can be an aid for modern industries which are dependent on the machines. Incorporating this bot in industries can lead to increasing the overall productivity of the industry by greater extent.
The body of the Bot would be made of sheet metal and the tires would have planetary gear arrangement in which single tire can carry a maximum load of 150Kg. There would be total of 6 tires powered from the motors. For carrying the load lead screw mechanism would be incorporated which has greater strength and easy rotating characteristics.
There would also be a digital touch screen LCD Screen which will show all the parameters such as battery capacity remaining beginning and end location total load carried etc. This would enable remote operation from both mobile as well as PC connected over a same network.

Nukkad Nattak was performed by the students of Dramatics Club outside the auditorium soon after the fun activities. The hungry crowd soon left for a hearty lunch in the football ground. As the sun beat down on PEC on this mildly cold February day there were only stories to pass around and nostalgic memories lingering in the atmosphere. When asked around to various alumni members of ranging years there were many special stories and interesting facts being told around. From having just 3 branches (mechanical civil and electrical) the college has indeed come a long way by now accommodating 8 branches. They were all pleased to see the new changes being brought about in the college whilst keeping the old infrastructure intact.
By late noon the alumni members were shown around the college for their respective branch tour. Just as the new students being enrolled into the college are taken around the various departments the alumni were too but this time each place held a special memory for them. There was also a panel discussion being held in the senate hall regarding a very important topic-How the alumni of Punjab engineering College could strengthen their network. Shortly after to conclude this wonderful day a gala dinner was hosted at the football ground. With a brief and touching vote of thanks the night led to a fest of songs and bhangra performances by the students. Not only this but the college's talented alumni also took to the stage to enthral us with their talents. To name a few Mr. Tejinder Singh Bedi a 1973 Electrical Engineering graduate a very illustrious singer known for singing with the great Jagjit Singh entertained the whole crowd with his performance.

https://pec.ac.in/donations/content/establishing-scholarships-financially-underprivileged-students,
Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh is looking to establish several scholarships for its students through philanthropic contributions. Currently an undergraduate student spends roughly Rs. 2.5 lakhs a year on tuition lodging and boarding. It is desirable that a scholarship provides some reasonable financial support compared to the total expenditure of the student. Hence it has been decided that the minimum amount of scholarship that can be established at PEC will be Rs. 50000 per annum. Donors may wish to establish scholarships with larger amounts.
In order to provide a scholarship of Rs. 50000 per annum it is proposed to establish an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs. The interest earned on this endowment will be used to disburse the scholarship amount. The excess interest (more than 5 percent) will be ploughed back to the endowment so that its amount also increases and in future the scholarship amount can be increased. It may be noted that despite some interest amount being added to the endowment the real value of endowment will reduce over a period of time due to inflation and a top up may be needed after some time.
A donor can specify the criteria for selection of students. These criteria could include merit (minimum CGPA for example) means (maximum income limit for example) or both. A donor could also specify the department in which the scholarship is to be established the year of the student (1st 2nd 3rd or 4th) or gender.
The scholarship can be named as per the wishes of the donor.
Currently the Institute is interested in supporting the following category of students:
Students from low income families:
Please note that the Institute may decide on additional criteria on eligibility for scholarships. For example it is expected that students getting means based scholarship will pass all courses while students getting merit based scholarships will have a CGPA of at least 8.5. It is also required that the student has not been barred as part of disciplinary action.
To encourage establishment of endowment based scholarships for those categories of students whom the Institute wants to support it has been decided that the scholarship amount will be matched by the Institute. So if a donor gives an endowment of Rs. 10 lakhs for a scholarship for a student from low income family with income less than Rs. 5 lakhs per annum the amount of scholarship to the student will be Rs. 1 lakh per annum (Rs. 50000 from the interest of the endowment and Rs. 50000 from the Institute funds).

Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University) has completed 98 wonderful years since it’s foundation in 1921. A celebratory event was organized to mark the foundation of the college which started with a lamp lightning ceremony. Chief guest Director PEC Dr. Dheeraj Sanghi ex-Directors Vijay Gupta and Manoj Datta shared the podium with Dr. Divya Bansal. The Chief Guests also included Dr. Siby John (Deputy Director) and Dr. Sushant Samir (Registrar).
The lamp lighting ceremony was followed by the Director’s speech where he started off by wishing Punjab Engineering College a very happy 98th Birthday. He highlighted his vision for the University and re-emphasized his plans to promote internships and taking up transferred semesters in various institutions and universities to gain lots of exposure something which is lacking in a lot of graduates of recent time. He also highlighted that Punjab Engineering College has the ‘top 1%’ of students and inherently it becomes the responsibility of the University to provide them with apt care attention and opportunities. His moto change India by taking one step at a time was highlighted to seek as much help and as much experience as one possibly could as it is only then that you learn.
He then introduced Dr. Vijay Gupta and elucidated that they both had a similar vision of what they wanted PEC to be. Dr. Gupta began on a light and yet an emotional note stating that he was surprised he needed a microphone as he had taken many a lecture in the same hall behind the same podium to an Auditorium full of students without ever needing a mic. His golden rule he stated was that he believed in making many mistakes but he’d rather err while experimenting than practicing. He too recognized the fact that providing a good student experience was paramount above all things. He then talked about how India still follows a science-based education system which is out of touch with our time and requirements. His speech was supplemented by Dr. Dutta. He opened his speech with a remarkable idea of ‘Free and Unrestricted Choice for Education’ and emphasized on continuous self-evaluation as a key to success. His main idea was that the University should take examples from other institutions but never try to copy or clone them the variance that a University provides over other institution is what attracts people. He also stated his idea about restructuring the M.Tech programs and provide more focus on them. His ideas to promote the entrepreneurship and start-ups in India were vivid and he highlighted the errs in using the ranking system for colleges and how they may be inaccurate and might lose their purpose.
A dance performance by the Dramatics Club of PEC and a video entailing the history of PEC and its highlights helped to raise the energy in the room.
The event ended by Dr. Divya Bansal thanking all dignitaries and students present there for helping make this day truly memorable.

Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Applied Science Department has received the INDIA 2020 TOP CITED PAPER AWARD for article “Sr and Mn co-doped sol-gel derived BiFeO3 ceramics with enhanced magnetism and reduced leakage current” Nandni Sharma et al 2017 Mater. Res. Express 4 015702. The Top Cited Paper Award is for corresponding authors from India for work published across the entire IOP Publishing portfolio in the past three years (2017 to 2019) using citations recorded in Web of Science. The papers are in the top one per cent of the most-cited articles in each subject category along with the most-cited review article published in the last three years.
In this article Sanjeev Kumar and his co-authors reported the effect of Sr and Mn doping on the electrical and magnetic characteristics of BiFeO3 nanoparticles synthesized by sol-gel technique. They observed that Sr doping in BiFeO3 showed substantial reduction in the leakage current whilst co-doping with Sr and Mn led to lower reduction in the leakage current through offering better performance over undoped BiFeO3 due to changes brought in the defect physics upon doping. Additionally Sr and Mn co-doped BiFeO3 samples exhibit enhanced magnetization in comparison to undoped and Sr doped BiFeO3 possibly due to interruptions in the spin cycloid of BiFeO3.
